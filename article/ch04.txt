Chapter 4 - User level libraries
----------

The user level libraries are fairly simplistic.

There are two files in this directory.  The first is the crt0.c file.
This file contains one function which is the _start() function.  This function
makes a call to main which will be defined in user code.  This stub
function must always be linked in first as it will be jumped into
by the kernel to begin running the process.

The second file is the syscall.c file.  This file contains one system
call function which is simply an interrupt 22.  This interrupt calls 
the console system call.  eax is passed in as a pointer to a string
which is printed to the system console.

Both of these source files are compiled to objects and are used during
the linking phase of any user code.

Chapter 5 - User code
----------

The user code is stored in one file called test.c  This file is located in
the /user/ directory.  All this code does is call the console system call
function provided by the library, wait a short amount of time, and call it again
in a non-terminating loop. (Good thing, as I don't handle task termination yet)

The important thing to note is that when linking this user process is
set to have a text segment of 20000h linear.  Also the crt0.o and syscall.o
files are linked in as well.  crt0.o is linked in first to insure that its
_start() function is at 20080h so it will be jumped into by the kernel. In
truth, _start() is the real main as opposed to the main() everyone is used
to dealing with.

This code is the task which is created and run alongside the kernel, as
described in chapter 3.

Conclusion
----------

The kernel contained within is far from complete.  However, it is a first
step towards creating a real protected mode operating system.  It is also
enough to begin workig with, or to refer to during you own work on
a protected mode operating system.  Doing this work is simply both one
of the most rewarding things you will ever do, and one of the most frustrating.
Many a night has been spent at the local tavern telling war stories about this
stuff.  But in the end, it has all been great fun.

I wish you all the best of luck!

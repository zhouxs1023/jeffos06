Chapter 6 - Creating a disk image out of the binaries
----------

Once you have compiled all of the binaries and placed them into the build
directory you will need to create two more files before continueing.
These files are called STUFF.BIN and STUFF2.BIN.  These files are simply
containers of empty space to cause alignment of other binaries.  The
floppy loader expects the user program to be 1k in size.  If the user program
is not exactly this size then STUFF2.BIN needs to be created and be of such
a size that when added to USER.BIN the size is 1024 bytes. Also, the
floppy boot loader expects the kernel boot loader to be 3.5k (3584 bytes) in 
size.  STUFF.BIN needs to be made of such length that when added to the size
of the BOOT.BIN (kernel boot loader) file the size will be 3584 bytes. In the
future I will try to automate this process, but for now this is simply how
it must be done. Once this is complete the shell program 'go' must be run.
This will place all of the binary files into one file called 'os.bin'. This
file can then be writen to disk by one of the following two methods.

If you want to do it from linux you can do the following command:

dd if=os.bin of=/dev/fd0  (places os.bin directly onto the floppy disk)

or from DOS you can obtain the rawrite command and run it and follow its
directions.

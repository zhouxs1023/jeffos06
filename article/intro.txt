Introduction
------------


Throughout this document I assume a certain level of knowledge on the part 
of the reader.  This knowledge includes c and assembly language programming, 
and x86 architecture.

The development requirements for the GuildOS operating system are:

An ELF compiler
  I used the gnu ELF compiler which comes with linux.  It is possible
  to use other ELF cross compilers on other systems as well.

a386 assembler
  This can be obtained from:

Eric Isaacson
416 E. University Ave.
Bloomington IN 47401-4739
71333.3154@compuserve.com

or call 1-812-335-1611
A86+D86+A386+D386 is $80
Printed maual $10

This is a really nice assembler.  Buy a copy.  I did.

  It is also possible to convert the boot loader assembly code to another
  assembler.

A 486+ machine
  You must have a machine to test the OS on.

Great books to read to gain an understanding of the various topics presented
in the following pages are:

Protected Mode Software Architecture by Tom Shanley from MindShare, Inc.
ISBN 0-201-55447-X  $29.95 US

This book covers the protected mode architecture of the x86.  It also
explains the differences between real mode and protected mode programming.
This book contains much of the information which is in the Intel Operating
Systems Developers guide, but also explains things much more in depth.

Developing Your Own 32-Bit Operating System by Richard A. Burgess from SAMS
Publishing.  ISBN  0-672-30655-7

This book covers the development of a complete 32-bit OS.  The author also
creates his own 32-bit assembler and compiler.  Considerable portions of
the code are written in asm, but there is still quite a bit in C.

The entire Intel architecture series and their OS developers guides which
are available from their web site for free.

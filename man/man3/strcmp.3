.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBstrcmp()\fP function compares the two strings \fIs1\fP and
\fIs2\fP.  It returns an integer less than, equal to, or greater 
than zero if \fIs1\fP is found, respectively, to be less than, 
to match, or be greater than \fIs2\fP.
.PP
The \fBstrncmp()\fP function is similar, except it only compares
the first \fIn\fP characters of \fIs1\fP.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The \fBstrcmp()\fP and \fBstrncmp()\fP functions return an integer 
less than, equal to, or greater than zero if \fIs1\fP (or the first 
\fIn\fP bytes thereof) is found, respectively, to be less than, to 
match, or be greater than \fIs2\fP.
